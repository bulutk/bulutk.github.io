<p>Gravi SurfACT opens up an entirely new way to attract vistors’ and customers’ attention in organizations and events, such as concerts, exhibitions, fairs. Gravi Interactive Floors uses the projection area on the floor as a display and the users’ body movements for interaction. Without the need of any remote control or external device and with its high playability, Gravi SurfACT succeeds to be the center of interest in any place it is installed.</p>
<p>The customizable infrastructure originating from Gravi’s unique technology accompanies the sensitive game controls and realistic graphics.

<p>The objective of the SurfaceScapes project is to  create a proof-of-concept for playing tabletop role-playing games on  the Microsoft Surface Table. We will be using Dungeons and Dragons as a  basis for our prototype, with the option for future expansion to other  role-playing games. SurfaceScapes will provide Game Masters and players  with a set of features to enhance the combat and role-playing aspects  of tabletop games. This will include the ability to interact with the  digital environment using real objects such as miniatures and provide  automated calculations and visual and audio feedback for actions  performed by the player and non-player characters. We are taking  traditional tabletop role-playing games to the next level, adding a new  layer of immersive and intuitive gaming to the Microsoft Surface Table  and assisting both GMs and players in enjoying exciting and engaging  adventures.</p>

<p>“Sketch it up!” is a software for testing game ideas in minutes with no coding, during idea creating phase of game production. We started on a pre-existing software and turn it into a product with a team of six. We worked in scrum cycles of two weeks. My role was to totally rewrite the network system to make it much more optimized and safe; make the server realize disconnected clients and clear resources; add simple shadows to the objects; write undo, redo, record movement and loop movement functions. We use Panda3d engine with Python.</p>
<p>We have given a demo of this software in ICEC'09 in Paris. <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/50g62j34lm533751/" target="_blank">link</a></p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 16px">Building Virtual Worlds Projects</strong></p>
<p>These following 5 projects are made in 2 week cycles with a team of 4 which changes every round.</p>
<p><strong>DragonForce</strong></p>
<p>In this experience the player uses head mounted display and magnetic sensors to enter the world of magical dragons. Player is bound to the dragon upon its birth. He trains and helps the dragon through events that changes the dragons life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blind Date</strong></p>
<p>The audience uses remotes to help our main character ( me ) through a blind date! This round's theme was story telling</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wizball</strong></p>
<p>The player uses his shadow on the projection screen to play a virtual themed pinball game and defeats a wizard in the end! This round was only one and a half week long.</p>

<p><strong>Mine Cart Adventure</strong></p>
<p>The player rides a mine cart through a collapsing  mine. The player experienced the world through a head mounted display and  navigating around with a stick. This round was native user round. The game was  designed to be played by people who have no experience in this kind of gaming.</p>
<p>We have show this world in the reception of <a href="http://www.etc.cmu.edu/icec2008/" target="_blank">ICEC'08</a> and also <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bvwpublic/the-show" target="_blank">BVW Show ' 08</a></p>

<p><strong>Steward's Snowboard Adventure</strong></p>
<p>The player uses head mounted display and trackers for helping a snowman by throwing penguins   at a dragon who wants to melt the snowman while sliding down from a mountain! This round theme was to help somebody who is afraid of another person.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 16px">Sabancı University Projects</strong></font></p>
<p><strong>Bird's Sight in VR</strong></p>
<p>A virtual reality environment was created for experiencing the world through the eyes of a bird. The users arm motion is tracked by magnetic motion tracking equipment and thus enable him/her to fly over a city with only swinging arms. The user can see the world in 3D as human sight or in 2D with 300 degrees of sight to simulate bird sight. We worked with OpenGL and low level tracker drivers in C++.</p>

<p><strong>Dızar</strong></p>
<p>We have designed and developed a 3d video  game in a team of two as a part of our Computer Graphics course. We have  implemented collision detection, simulated dynamics, multiplayer support over a  network, artificial intelligence, 3D sound support, user interface as well as  using phong shaders for smoother looking objects in the world. We have used  Opengl API and GLUT and write the code in C++.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 16px">Independent Project</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>BannerRunner</strong></p>
<p>Bannerrunner is a tool I have developed to address  the course registration problems in my undergrad university. The students have  to spend hours in front of their pc's to enter the bannerweb to register to  their courses. They have to click the enter button see if it is successful and  if not use the back button in the browser and do the cycle again until they got  in the system. This tool automates this process and adds more features. It has multiple  threads running at the same time so it is much faster than any human being can  ever be. And even if we got a login screen because of the heavy load on the  server there is a chance that the user cannot login so BannerRunner logs in  with the pre entered user id and password and if the login is unsuccessful  continues on trying without notifying the user. If it is successful it plays a  nice Mario song to notify the user that login was successful. But BannerRunners  advantages don't finish once we login the site as it has buttons to navigate  into the add drop course page which is a few pages deep from the main screen.</p>
<p>Currently I estimate it to be used by over couple thousand people every course registration period, and I have released more than  15 versions to address various bugs and feature request from the users. The latest  version has an automated update function build in.</p>
